## Chiro Maldegem Website

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for members, parents of members and leaders of the youth group Chiro PAO Maldegem.

### Activities
Leaders and members are both part of a 'group', which is bound to an age. Leaders of a group can add activities (which they plan for the next week in most cases).
Afterwords, they can update these activities with photos and changethe description. Only leaders and parents of members of the group can see the activities of that group.


### Events
Leaders are also responsible for an 'event', for which a member should subscribe. These events are the same every year, and each leader is responsible for one event.
Members can only subscribe for an event if they have already subscribed for the year.
